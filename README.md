# Benzene

This is a starter template I have created for a modern C++ application.

## Dependencies

The following are the dependencies associated with this project:

1. **MSVC Compiler**: The MSVC Compiler, instead of the TDM-gcc compiler, is more suitable for projects that are Windows-specific and use Windows-specific features. Although, for the most part, TDM-gcc too can compiler applications using the Windows API. In order to make this compiler work, however, you need a bunch of environment variables set in the terminal. This can be done automatically by using the _Developer Command Prompt for VS_ or by running a batch script that sets up the required variables.

2. **CMake**: CMake is a build tool that can build multiple source files in one go.

3. **Conan**: Conan is a package manager for C and C++ projects.
